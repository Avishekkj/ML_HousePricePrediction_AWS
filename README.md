I have developed a Machine learning prediction Model that predicts price of home based on customer detail provided while filling online application form. Model was build using sklearn and linear regression using banglore home prices dataset from kaggle.com. The Application is developed using Flask framework and Bootstrap and deployed on AWS EC2 - instance , using NGINX as a HTTP server.During model building I  have cover almost all data science concepts such as data load and cleaning, outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, gridsearchcv for hyperparameter tunning, k fold cross validation etc.
